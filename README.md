# DAT257/DIT257 - Team Apricot

Welcome to team Apricot's GitHub repository!

## Project description
Team Apricot has designed and developed an Android application used to motivate users to go out for a walk. The app will generate random positions for the user to walk to, and whenever the user arrives at the destination, the app will prompt the user to take a photo to keep as a memory. Once the photo has been taken, it will be visible on the map in the app, and the user can click on the photo to view it again.

## External resources

Since we have chosen to develop an Android application, we have made good use of the Android SDK, and the corresponding documentation from Google: [developer.android.com](https://developer.android.com/).
For our external data source, we have used OpenStreetMap to create the map view in our Android application. To use OpenStreetMap, we have used a library called osmdroid, and their corresponding documentation: [osmdroid.github.io](https://osmdroid.github.io/osmdroid/).
We use a local SQLite database within the app to store paths to photos, store routes and achievements. To use an SQLite database within Android, we have used the Android Room API: [Android Room documentation](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/room)
