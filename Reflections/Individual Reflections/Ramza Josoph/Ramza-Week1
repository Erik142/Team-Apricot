● What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to learn more about the scrum process, specifically more about the scrum
master role. I also want to learn what useful tools they are to help us apply all the
theory we learn in class about scrum into our own project.
● how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
The best way to help each other learn something new is to always share information
between each other. I can help my team members by being the one asking questions
often, if some team members don’t feel comfortable asking a question, I don’t mind
being the one to ask the group to get clarification on things for example.
● what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum? what is my
contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
My contribution to the use of Scrum and the team's deliveries is to hold a specific
role and also ensure I do the tasks assigned for that role. Since scrum is a team
work process I also have to keep good communication with my team and make sure
everybody is on the same page.
