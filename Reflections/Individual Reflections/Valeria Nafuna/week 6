what is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s use of Scrum?
i follow that we follow the social contract and that i follow the DoD when doing my task.
i also attend the sprint meeting to follow up on the progress of the project and give my suggestions incase any.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
in case someone has some question about the stuff i have learnt during this project, i can help them by explaing to them.

what do I want to learn or understand better?
well i have had some proctises with the version control method we have been using but i wish i coul be more comfortable with it
