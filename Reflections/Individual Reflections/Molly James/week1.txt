I want to learn how to calculate workload estimation for tasks and how they can be compared to other estimations. I can help my team to learn 
something new by keeping a clear communication with my teammates and stay up to date with my tasks to be able to help someone else. My contribution 
to the team’s use of Scrum is the active responsibility of my own participation as well as the team member's participation to ensure a successful use 
of Scrum. My contribution to the team’s deliveries is active participation and inclusion of participation and keeping up to date with teammate workload 
to make sure that everyone is on task and able to handle their own workload. If a teammate is not able to handle their workload i will step in to assist 
the best way possible.
