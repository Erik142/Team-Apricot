# Individual reflection, week 4

Work is progressing, and I think I'm getting into the Scrum mindset pretty
well. I've finished my tasks without too many hiccups, and I'm mostly happy
with how we're progressing. Our user stories and tasks could be a bit more
parallellizable, but we'll work on that. Next sprint I'll try to learn a
bit more of the inner workings of Android, and will probably be able to
clean up some of the uglier parts of my code during refactoring.

This sprint, I contributed with the two last tasks from the user story from
last sprint, and I mostly finished another. It will need to be refactored
a bit when some other things are done, but it's ready to provide value right
now. ;) Next sprint, I will (hopefully) have time to clean some code up and
do things more in "the right way", as well as work on new user stories.
