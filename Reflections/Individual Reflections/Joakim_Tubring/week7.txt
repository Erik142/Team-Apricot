What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to say everything these weeks have moved fast and though i feel like i have learned how scrum can be used in projects. This was i strange course but i think a learned a thing or 2 about groupdynamics this week in the sence of when we start to know each other the project and the tasks move much faster because communication is better. I am not much for communicating in general i have ADHD so could be somewhat difficult with certain parts when you really need to be social but get stuck doing something that are not going to work but you need to try it until it fails misserably. Good course and a good experience!!!

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Maybe in defining what needs to be written about certain things in reports i feel that i rarely do not have an idea about what to write.

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Participated in the sprint planning and end meeting. Not much else have been writing most of the time.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Written on team reflection and final report not much else done this week has been exam week and much to do in everyone of the 3 courses i am taking.
