What do I want to learn or understand better?
I wan't to learn how threads are handled in android we are getting errors reffering to running tasks on the main thread this week. Might help to learn about these things.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I can probably lend some assistance regarding the database itself because i have worked with serverbased databases before.

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Participated in the sprint planning and end meeting. Do not now if i have contributed more have been focusing on finishing my task for the most of the time.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
We finally got the database working have been writing the classes to mirror and some of the base code for creating the database.
