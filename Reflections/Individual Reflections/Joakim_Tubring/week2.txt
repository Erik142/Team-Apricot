What do I want to learn or understand better?
Not so much this week.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Maybe when we start modelling the solution i will be able to help more.

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
We did not really use scrum for anything this week. The deliverables where about defining what we wanted to build.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Participated in the meeting when we decided on the project and attended this weeks workshop.
