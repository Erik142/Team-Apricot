What do I want to learn or understand better?
       
I want to understand scrum better. It seems a bit stressful to constantly having contact with product owner instead of having a clear plan on how the increments should be done from the start. Maybe there is some advantages to this but at the moment it seems there are very much communication and not so much time to do the work atleast when looking at how the workshop went.


How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
      
Maybe when we start programming I will be able to help more. At the moment not so much.


What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
      
Not so much at the moment. We have not really started on the project part. In the workshop I worked on building walls in the supermarket.


What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
      
Not so much at the moment contributed with some suggestions on what goes into the social contract.
