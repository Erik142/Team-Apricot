What do I want to learn or understand better?
I wan´t to learn about how you should think about modelling situations when the priority seems to be to get something with value each sprint these seems to be somewhat in conflict with each other.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Not so much this week.

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Participated in the sprint planning and sent a reflection on what i had done the day in question for most days.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I am still working on my task at the time of speeking hopefully will be done at the end of the sprint.

Sorry for late submission of this wrote it then forgot to upload it.
