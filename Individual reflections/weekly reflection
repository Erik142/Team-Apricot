what do I want to learn or understand better?: after this weeks exercise,i noticed that need to learn more how to work with scrum, to divide the workload among teammates,find a way of doing my part alongside other works in progress. 
I can contribute to the team by reading more about scrum and being actively involved in the discussions.
