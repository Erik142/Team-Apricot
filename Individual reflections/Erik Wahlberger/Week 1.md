# Erik Wahlberger - Individual reflection week 1

So far, the team has not yet decided on a project. We have therefore not yet started with the development of the software. Therefore, this week's individual reflection will most likely be shorter than the following weeks, since there will be more things to reflect on later on.

Everything regarding agile methods and SCRUM in general is still very new. I believe that minetest exercise this week proved that working with agile methods can produce results very fast, IF you and your team does it the right way. During the sprints in the exercise, it was difficult to get started since the team felt that the user stories were not specific enough. Before even starting to build, we raised questions such as: "What material should we use for the building?", "How large should the building be?" etc. So I definitely want to learn more about how to avoid these types of issues, how the team can specify these user stories further to allow the development to continue without raising questions about **how** to do something properly.

I believe that some of the team members are new to git and Github. I have been working in Github for a while, so I hope that I can provide the team with some assistance regarding git issues (branching, merge conflicts etc), as well as setting up GitHub automations that the team can use during the development of the project (devops). Right now, no automations are set up in the repo. The goal for next week is to discuss with the team what kind of automations that we want to incorporate into the repo, and then add those before starting the development of the software. 

The team has not been using any SCRUM methods this week, since the project idea has not yet been chosen, so I cannot comment on what my contribution towards the teams' use of Scrum is (yet).

So far, I think that everybody in the team has contributed equally to the team's deliveries. I wrote up the social contract in a more structured form since every team member had written down their thoughts and suggestions regarding the contract.

All in all, not a whole lot to reflect on this week. I am very excited to get started with the project, so I am looking forward a lot to next week!
