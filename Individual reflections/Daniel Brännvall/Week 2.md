# Individual reflection, week 2

Last week didn't involve too much Scrum-related stuff, and "real life"
interfered a bit with my school work, so I haven't done as much learning
as I'd like, unfortunately. I will keep the goal from last week and
read up on things as the need arises, and additionally, I intend to
learn the basics of Android app creation, using mostly the documentation
and, if necessary, other sources I find online.

I'm not the best pedagogue, but I do have a lot of experience of
programming, so I should be able to help my team with programming-related
questions if they need it.

I've taken on the role of product owner, and I hope I will be able to
help prioritise tasks and focus the team on the important ones.

We decided together what app to build, I contributed in the discussion
and also created the mockup (which isn't a "this is the way the app
WILL look" thing, more like "something like this, maybe, but...
hopefully better").
