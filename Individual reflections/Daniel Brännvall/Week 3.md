# Individual reflection, week 3

This week we have begun work on the application, so I'm being exposed
to more SCRUM stuff now, and I'm starting to feel more comfortable
with the process. I've also started learning the basics of Android
app development, and I'm starting to get a pretty good idea about
how to approach it. I intend to keep learning about the SCRUM process
by reading up on it as the need arises, and I'll probably need to
spend some studying libraries we're using.

I try to help out with answering questions when needed, and, in the
role of PO, I help out with prioritizing tasks and describing my
"vision" for the app when needed.

I've contributed to the project by finishing part of a user story,
and I've prepared to finish the last two tasks of it later tonight.
Progress has been a bit slower than I was hoping, because of my
lack of experience with Android, but that's improving and I think
I'm getting up to speed. I look forward to working on more user
stories in the next sprint, and hopefully get some more done.
