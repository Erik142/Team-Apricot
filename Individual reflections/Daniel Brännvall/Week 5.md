# Individual reflection, week 5

I've been sick, so I haven't progressed as much as I'd like to. I am getting
the hang of "the Android Way" to do things, I think, and I feel comfortable
I'll be able to finish the user stories I've been assigned. Next sprint I'll
focus on learning what I need to finish my task(s), probably something
OsmDroid-related.

I've contributed with finishing a couple of user stories, and by refactoring
one from last sprint to use our version of the MVC pattern. I've also
assisted my team mates with input on how I (as PO) think some things should
work.
