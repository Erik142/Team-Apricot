# Individual reflection, week 6

A laboration in my other course proved to be a bit trickier than expected,
so I haven't been able to contribute as much as I would like this sprint
(this is starting to feel like a theme, and I don't like it.)

Figuring out how to do things is starting to feel a lot easier than in
the beginning, so I think I'm definitely learning how these things work.
Next sprint will probably be a bit busy, so I'm not sure I'll have time
to focus on learning new things other than what is absolutely necessary.
