# Project scope/Customer value

The project scope was created in the beginning of the course. The group took into consideration that we have a limited amount of time to finish the project, and adjusted the scope accordingly. 

Value has primarily been added for the user of the application and to the developers. The team has prioritized core features that would create engagement from the users. The team has had discussions together to find out what features are the most important for the users of the application.

While the team has not talked a lot about success criterias about learning outcomes, teamwork or effort, each team member has in fact had their own success criterias during the course. We have mostly focused on having joint success criterias for the application itself.

We should have done effort estimation for all of the user stories as they are created. By waiting with the effort estimation, we have had some issues with how many user stories that the team can take on during one sprint. Acceptance criterias have been overlooked in some of the user stories since most of the user stories have been created during the sprint planning meetings, which has lead to stress when creating user stories, which in turn leads to poor or no acceptance criterias.

The group has not had a clear strategy for testing the software. We talked about using unit testing with JUnit, but that never happened. During the project, we established a dedicated DoD file which consists of clearer review criterias to decide when something is truly done. But for testing the software, we have only used manual tests so far. Worth noting is that in the beginning, the DoD was integrated into the social contract, so it was more difficult to actually find what the DoD consisted of and what the social contract consisted of.

We have our three KPIs, we fill them out every sprint, but we don’t use them for anything in special. They are however a motivational factor for the team members, they make each team member want to work more every sprint. We haven’t talked about ideal values for the KPIs, so we don’t really have any values that we are working towards.

To get to the point where we want to be with regards to effort estimation, creation of user stories and acceptance criterias, we will re-evaluate the effort estimation for existing user stories. We will also try to perform effort estimation for user stories as soon as they are created. We will also try to create user stories throughout the entire sprint. This will give us more time to create each user story, as well as creating good acceptance criterias for each user story.



# Social contract and effort

The social contract has been used as a guideline when working with the project. We have only had one team meeting where we taook another look at the contract, discussing it further. During this meeting we came to the conclusion that we were perfectly happy with the current social contract and that we didn't have anything in particular that we wanted to change in it.

Most of us have looked through the contract in the beginning of the course, but haven’t really used it afterwards. Some of us have been checking out the updated versions, but again, not really used it afterwards. Main reason is that the content of the social contract felt obvious and didn’t need to be checked more than once. 

The social contract has been seen as a tool to resolve potential conflicts throughout the project, but we haven’t really had any conflicts, therefore we haven’t had to actively use the social contract all the time.

We have developed an Android application during our project, and some team members haven’t worked with Android development before. Therefore it has been more time consuming to debug errors compared to working with native Java code made for PC. Lots of Java classes have been written, but the team doesn’t feel like the amount of classes written corresponds well to the features that have been added. Also other tools such as git for version control has proved to be time consuming because the team members have different previous experience with it. All in all, we do however feel that the hours spent on the project are mostly well balanced with the features that have been finished, just not the amount of classes that have been written to reach those features.
