# Social contract - Team Apricot

Team Apricot has agreed on following and acting corresponding to the following points:

- The team will use GitHub as its Git platform. GitHub will be used not only for source control, but also for storing the SCRUM board and user stories using GitHub Project Boards.
- The methods in the source code will be kept as short and simple as possible.
- All code shall be commented. Either comments within methods, or JavaDoc:ed methods. Both are preferred.
- No single team member shall change another team member's code without first consulting the team member responsible for said code.
- The code shall be tested before merging it.
- The team shall work together as a group. Every person's opinion matters. No one shall work entirely by themselves without consulting the team.
- Everybody in the team shall actively participate in all parts of the project (effort estimation, assignment of user stories, software development, code review, team reflection).
- The team will work in sprints. Each sprint will be one week long. In the beginning of each sprint, the team members will take part in an obligatory sprint meeting. During the sprint meeting, new user stories will be discussed, effort estimation will be performed for these new user stories. User stories will be assigned to the team members according to the priority of each user story. The team will also reflect on the previous sprint during this meeting.
- The team will use separate git branches to develop separate features. For each branch, a pull request will be created in GitHub where at least one review of the new code will be required, as well as a test to see that the code compiles correctly, before it is allowed to merge it with the rest of the software.
- Each team member is responsible for communicating to the rest of the team if their workload becomes overbearing.
- Each team member is responsible for settling potential disagreements/conflicts in a mature and professional way.
- The team will discuss issues/differences in opinions that arise. If it is not immediately resolved, the discussions will be put on a 5 min timer, and if it is not resolved by then the conflict will be put up for a vote.
- The team will make sure to do everything in their power to finish deadlines before the actual day of the deadline.
- The SCRUM master will be responsible for the following tasks:
    - Make sure everyone follows the agreements under the sprints and social contract.
    - Be available for questions and concerns every checkup meeting. Plan and resolve any conflict, role or task changes.
