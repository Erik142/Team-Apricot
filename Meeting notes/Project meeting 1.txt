Walking app

7/9-2021
We all agreed on focus on a walking app. Sustainable goal nr 3: good health and well being
Target audience: anyone who thinks they’re too old for pokemon go. Age over 10. 
Premise: an app for people who like to get a bit more exercise. It gives you a target to walk to, take a pictures. Short/medium/long distance. The app randomizes a point and tells you to get there. When you’ve gotten there it saves and saves data. Achievements on how many spots you’ve found, distance. Targets anyone who wants to get a bit more exercise.
The team determined to work with android since it’s easier to work with. Since you take pictures,  tracks locations, walking data, time, we find it appropriate to make an app. 
The person should take a picture of anything, themselves, nature, surroundings for memorabilia. The route is finished once you’ve taken the picture. You should use the app to take the picture.
The reason why the group want to do this project is to encourage people to walk, the use of E-Scooters has discouraged people from walking. 


Second priority: make an account. would be to add friends. We would have to make a server for that. “Social media”
